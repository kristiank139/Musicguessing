# Musicguessing
All webm files CANNOT have colon(:) nor a semicolon(;) in their name
# A Python program to help memorize the title, author and genre of a song.

## Using this program:

1. Enter a Youtube video link or playlist link and download the files
2. After downloading, click "Play song" to start playing the songs
3. While the song is playing, you should rename the file with the appropriate title. The title you set will be the title you have to guess. Do not put dots(.) or dashes(-) to the title.
4. Now you can guess the current playing song.
5. If all the songs have been guessed, restart the program and u can start guessing again.

## Program problems:

1. Title cannot include many characters
2. No way to reveal the correct title yet
