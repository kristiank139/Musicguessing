# A Python program to help memorize the title, author and genre of a song.

## Using this program:

1. Enter a link or playlist link and download the files
2. After downloading, click "Play song" to start playing the songs
3. While the song is playing, you should rename the file with the author, genre and title. These CANNOT include dots(.), colons(:), semicolons(;) or dashes(-), everything else should be fine. If one of the arguments isn't necessary, then do not leave it as blank.
4. Now you can guess the current playing song, words have to be in order: 1)author, 2)genre and 3)title
5. If all the songs have been guessed, restart the program and u can start guessing again.

## Program problems:

1. Author, title or genre can't be left blank
2. They have to be in order while guessing.
3. They cannot include many charactes
4. After all the songs have been played, the program should continue
5. There are probably a lot of bugs
